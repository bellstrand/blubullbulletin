<h1>About</h1>
<p>This website is a project for a course called PHP-MVC at Blekinges Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is basically to create a "complete" website based on the CMF we have build during the course.</p>
<p>To reach our goal we have had 3 weeks of work and some support from our teachers.</p>
<p>The website is supposed to be a news site with some satire / odd news, but i've also added some interesting stuff based on RSS feeds cause i wasn't able to find any good feed for these kind of news.</p>
<p>So the first three menu items (Latest, News and Sport) is content lying on this homepage, generated with the install process or created by the sites users.</p>
<p>The fourth menu item (Music) contains RSS feeds from a Music site that reviews albums etc.</p>
<p>The fifth menu item (CVG) contains Computer and Video Game related stuff, with the use of RSS feeds there as well, the site includes RSS feeds from TeamLiquid, IGN, N4G and more.</p>
<p>The sixth menu item (Livestream) contains some recent RSS feeds from a community site surrounding around DotA and a sidebar with links to some popular streamers, if they are online streaming at the moment and also their current view count in square brackets.</p>
<p>The site-name, logotype and color-theme of the site is taken spontaneous from a friend of mine when i asked him about it out of the blue. Thanks Emanuel Habtu.</p>
